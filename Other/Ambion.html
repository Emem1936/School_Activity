<p>
Our reponses today reflect our experience yesterday. The talents
we each blessed with can only be developed if we use them fully to
benefit the lives of others as well as our own. Yes, past events
contribute to our own; yes, the present will help to determine the
future. But we can't do anything about them; the past and the
future are out of our reach. The present is valuable, this faith
tell us: it is all we have.</p>

<p>
The journey is the process of enlighrtenment for which we all have
gathered. From one another we are receiving that which we're ready
to learn. We have no power over the events of today, except our
power over our own behavior. </p>

<p>
We make plans for the future, we invoke memories of the past, but
really, all we have to deal with and to act in is the moment at
hand. We cannot stop its going; we cannot hurry the next moment on
its way. And what we do with this time is ours to decide. </p>

<p>
We receive love when we give love, with no strings attached. Love 
of self is assured when we understand our worth, our actual
necessity int the larger picture of the events tha touch us all.
When we realize our value and see that life's mysteries have
reason, we'll no longer doubt ourselves and we'll be free to love
and understand another's value too.</p></font>

<center><h3><p>"On the street I saw a small girl<br>Cold and 
Shivering in a thin dress,<br> With little hope of a<br>Decent
meal.<br><br>I Became angry and said<br>God:<br>"Why did you permit
this?<br>Why don't you do something<br>About it?'<br>For awhile God
said nothing.<br><br>'I certainly did something about it;<br><br>
I MADE YOU'".<br></p></h3></center><br>
