<h1>HOME AND THE OFFICE</h1>
<h2>First Stanza</h2>
<p>
Home is the place where the laughter should ring,<br>
And man should be found at his best.<br>
Let cares of the day be as great as they may,<br>
The night has been fashioned for rest.<br>
So leave at the door when the toiling is o'er<br>
All the burdens of worktime behid,<br>
And just be a dad to your girl or your lad--
A dad of the rollicking kind.
</p>

<h3>Second Stanza</h3>
<pre>The office is made for the tasks you must face;
It is built for the work you must do;
You may sit there and sigh as your cares pile up high,
And no one may criticize you;
you may worry and fret as you think of your debt,
You may worry and fret as you think of your debt,
You may grumble when plans go astray,
But when it comes night, and you shut your desk tight,
Don't carry the burdens away.</pre>

<h4 style="font-size:300%;">Third Stanza</h4>
<p style="font-size:160%;">
Keep daytime for toil and the nighttime for play,
Work as hard as you choose in the town,
But when the day ends, and the darkness descends,
Just forget that you're wearing a frown--</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Go home with a smile! Oh, you'll find it worth while;
Go home light of heart and of mind;
Go hoome and be glad that you're loved as a dad,
A dad of the fun-loving kind.</p>

<h1 style="border:2px solid blue;">Second Poem</h1>
<h1 style="text-align:center;">TO THE BOY</h1>
<p style="color:red;">
I have no wish, my little lad,
To climb the towering heights of fame.
I am content to be your dad
And share with you each pleasant game.
I am content <mark>to hold your</mark></p>
<p><b>And walk along life's path wit you,
And talk of things we understand--
The Birds and trees and skies of blue.</p></b>
<p><i>Though some may seek the smiles of kings,
for me your laughter's joy enough;
I have no wish to claim the things
Which lure men into pathways rough.</i></p>
<p>I'm<sup>happiest</sup>when you and I,
Unmindful of life's <sub>bitter</sub>cares,
Togethere watch the<ins>clouds</ins>drift by,
Or follow bohood's <del>thoroughfares.</del></p>
<p style="color:#0000ff;">If but this comradeship may last
Until I end my earthly task--
Your hand and mine by love held fast--
Fame has no charm for which I'd ask.</p>
<pre>
I would not trade one day with you
To wear the purple robes of power,
Nor drop your hand from mine to do
Some great deed in a selfish hour.
For you have brought me joy serene
And made my soul supremely glad.
in life rewarded I have been;
'Twas all worth while to be your dad.</pre>
