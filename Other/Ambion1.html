"The Universe can be likened to a puzzle or Rubik's Cube with coloured squares that slide into every<br>
imaginable place on an orderly grid. You are the person pushing the squares... so what colours,<br>
informations, patterns and directions do you choose to take with each square in your life? Thinking<br>
three steps ahead before you push a square can be highly benificial for your future. Pre-metidated<br>
acts and thoughs are paramount to succeding quickly and efficiently those goals which you sight<br>
for yourself in the long term.</p>
<p>
Most of us say that God, or destiny or whatever superior force may exist in this universe <br>
is that which make our future that guides us throughout ou futile existence. Isn't a force which guides us'<br>
which takes care of us, but the main element that helps us build up our future is our way of being?<br>
Our personality, our character, our way of perceiving reality and everything that surrounds us are the <br>
elements which may bring us to the top, or on the contrary, make us miserable.
</p>
<p>
It's simply your own choice if you don't want to study, to go to college, to have career. It really<br>
doesn't matter if your parents threten you, they punish you, scold you all the time. If you are<br>
stubborn and you think you know it all then all these are useless.
</p>
<p>
Every choice you make right now has an impact on your future and the future of many others.<br>
Whether you want to accept this or not, it is true.</p>

You consider that you can't find your place in your own country, so you risk the comfortable but<br>
modest life you have living with your parents and you go abroad. Maybe there will be moments when<br>
you can't stand anymore the loneliness, the strangers around you, or your job. But you remember<br>
nobody made you take that decision, so you take a deep breath, and you go on, as it's very difficult<br>
to find a guilty person when you know it well you the only one to be blamed.
</p>
<p>
If you fall in love with a man from the very first moment you set your eyes on him and you don't want<br>
to meet somebody else, to see how they are it's your wish. if you get married and the marriage ends <br>
in a year's time, you can't blame the rest as they all had told you to be careful and never to take<br>
hasty.</p>

<p>You play the lottery each day and there are two options: either you hit the jack pot and your life<br>
changes radically or you lose and you have to start it from the very beginning. On the contrary, its<br>
well known that if you don't risk you can't win so the best solution is always to think over and over<br>
again your decisions, to see what they could represent in your future and only afterwards to make up<br>
your mind.</p>

<p>You are the only architech of your future. The rest are only workers who help you create your own<br>
dream.</p>

<p>Being an archictech is all about rewards. you are constantly intentionally building necessarry<br>
structures to support lofty ambitions. Only master architects are able to jump from the foundation to<br>
the attic immediately in one push of a square. Most of us find there are a few levels to coordinate as<br>
we slowly climb our personal mountain through the journey of life.</p>

<p>The quicker and more seamlessly our rewards and steps are put into place for us, the journey<br>
upwards becomes a straight, easy path to climb - as opposed to a c onfusing labyrinth full of twists<br>
and turns which often lead to dead ends and disappointment, and are a general waste of our energy.</p>

<p>Channel your enery in a straight line in front of you, and move all of the necessary blocks and<br>
squares in place or out of the way to enable you to walk your path straight and true and claim your<br>
heart's desire.</p>
