<h1 style="font-size:300%;">The Story of my Life</h1>
<pre style="color:white;">
Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that
they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach
you lesson, or to help you figure out whom you are or who you
want to become. You never know who these people may be (possibly
your roommate, neighbor, coworker, long lost friend, lover, or even
a complete stanger) but when you look to their eyes, you know that
very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way.
</pre>

<p style="color:white;">And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and <br>
unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcomming those obstacles<br>
you would have never realized your <sub>potential</sub>, <sup>strenght</sup>,<sub> willpower</sub>, or<sup> heart</sup>.</p>

<pre style="color:white;"> Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by
means of luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true
greatness, and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your 
soul. Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would
be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. It would
be safe and comportable, but dull and utterly pointless.</pre>

<p style="color:white;">The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you <br>
experience help to creat who you become. <b>Even the bad experiences can <br>
be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and <br>
important ones. </b>If someone <i>hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart,<br>
forve them,</i> for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of<br>
being cautions when you open your heart. If somesone loves you, love them<br>
back unconditionally, not only beacuase they love you, but because in a way,<br>
they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things.</p>

<p style="color:white;">
<mark>Maked every day count!!!</mark> Appreciate every moment and take from those<br>
moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to<br>
experience it again. Talk to people that you have never talked to before, and<br>
actually listen. Let yourself fall inlove, break free, and set your sights high.<br>
Hold your head up because you have every right to. <ins>Tell yourself you are a<br>
great individual and believe in yourself</ins>, for if you don't believe in yourself,it will <br>
be hard for others to believe in you. You can make of your life anything you<br>
wish. Creat your own lif then go out and live it with absolutely <del>no regrets</del>.
