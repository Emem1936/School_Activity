										<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="#">Maharot and mainstream success</a></h2>
										<p>In 2006, they released their second album, "Maharot". The carrier single of the album was "Narda", which is about the fictional Filipina super hero Darna. "Narda" was a popular hit in 2006, and gained constant radio airplay in the same year, eventually becoming the band's signature song. The song was inspired by GMA Network's 2005 primetime show Darna which starred Angel Locsin. Later in 2009, it was used for GMA Network's primetime show Darna with Marian Rivera playing the title role. The band also borrowed from other genres of music in composing their songs for the album, as evidenced by the metal-inspired sound of the tracks "Sobrang Init" and "KKK", the pop-punk styling of the songs "Director's Cut" and "Martyr Nyebera" and the reggae-sounding feel of "Petix". Maharot was recognized for its sound, and further propelled the band to mainstream success. The band maintains close ties with another popular Filipino band, Parokya ni Edgar (PNE). PNE frontman Chito Miranda met the band members in college. In concert events with both bands on the bill, one band's singer would occasionally jam with the other band. During Parokya ni Edgar's live sessions, Contreras frequently joined Miranda in performing songs such as "Okatokat", "Chikinini" and "The Yes Yes Show." In 2005, Contreras provided back-up vocals for PNE's hit song "The Order Taker" while co-member Linao provided lead guitar. In turn, Kaye Abad, Miranda's then-girlfriend, provided back-up vocals for Kamikazee's song "Martyr Nyebera". Contreras later married Kaye Abad's sister, Sarah, on February 12, 2009 at Paco Park. In December 2008 when Kamikazee was set to perform at the Dubai Festival City in Dubai, United Arab Emirates as part of an international tour, guitarist Led Tuyay was arrested at the airport upon their arrival after a cannabis residue was found in his luggage. Tuyay was detained and deported back to Manila in January 2009.</p></div>

										<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="#">Long Time Noisy and Romantico
										</a></h2>
										<p>Kamikazee's 3rd Album "Long Time Noisy" took the band three years to put together as the band balanced out their tough schedules. The album was recorded at Tower of Doom Studios with producer Eric Perlas. "Unang Tikim," one of the album's singles, was used in the TV Ad of RC Cola in 2011. The album's writing style and music retained elements from their previous work, mainly in song structure and subject matter such as everyday life, drug use, and personal experiences. Kamikazee's fourth & final album, "Romantico" was released after being in production for 3 years. The album contained the singles "Halik" & "Huling Sayaw" with RNB singer Kyla on guest vocals. "Romantico" was well-received, despite minor criticism from some fans regarding the change of musical style in the album. </p></div>
